# ZigZag with Extras

This code is an enhanced version of the ZigZag indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MT5). The ZigZag indicator is a technical analysis tool that helps identify significant changes in price movements. This enhanced version includes additional features such as depth channel display, highlighting previous ZigZag points, break-out alerts, and push notifications.

## Features

### Calculate Depth Channel

The `CalculateDepthChannel()` function is responsible for calculating and plotting the depth channel display. This feature helps visualize the depth of price movements within a specified range.

### Highlight ZigZag Points

The `HighlightZigZagPoints()` function is used to identify and highlight previous ZigZag points. This feature makes it easier to recognize important turning points in the price chart.

### Breakout Alerts

The `BreakoutAlert()` function triggers break-out alerts based on predefined criteria. This feature alerts the user when the price breaks out of a specific range or pattern, allowing for potential trading opportunities.

### Send Push Notifications

The `SendPushNotification()` function sends push notifications to mobile devices. This feature keeps the user informed about important price movements, even when they are away from their trading platform.
